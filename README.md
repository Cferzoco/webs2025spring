For my project I wanted to create an online journaling webpage that gives the viewer prompts and access to their journal from a mobile device. As someone who journals, I know taht it was difficult to stay consistant oin the beginning. With a webpage like this, people who are new to journaling will have easier access to a safe space for their thoughts. Along with this, I wanted to create prompts that would be applicable to anyone. to do this, I wanted to start with a morning check in at the start of the day, and end with a recap section to add in feelings from the entire day. 
My goal is to mak ejournaling easier as I know first hand how much it can help as long as you stay consistant with it!
